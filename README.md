# FMAA-OPT：Coupled multiobjective optimization and fuzzy multicriteria acceptability analysis model for decision-making
FMAA.mlx is the code for decision making under conditions of fuzzy information (fuzzy multicriteria acceptability analysis).
TOPSIS.mlx is the code for the comparison of different alternatives.
result.xlsx is the comparison results of heat maps for the 15 alternatives in the case study.
data.xlsx is utility values of the 4 objective functions under 15 alternatives in the case sutdy.
Multiobjective optimization is implemented using the Platemo (Evolutionary multiobjective optimization platform based on MATLAB)
In addition to NSGA-Ⅲ used in the case study, many other multi-objective optimisation algorithms are also included.
The copyright of PlatEMO belongs to the BIMK Group. This tool is mainly for research and educational purposes.
Our study refers to this multiobjective algorithm for practical ecological reservoir operation applications.

## Installation
-MATLAB R2019b and later versions are required.
